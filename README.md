# Student_Performance_Prediction_Model
What increases a student's chance of passing or failing a class in secondary school? 
Most of us would assume that the number of absences, participation in class, and past grades are enough to predict a student's
performance. However, there are other elements that might not be apparent or simple to measure but have an impact on a student's
academic success, such as their home life, family, aspirations, and even their health.
Analysing and predicting student performance is important because it enables schools and teachers to address the problem, provide
support, and make informed decisions regarding academic programmes.
In this project, we will develop a machine learning model that focuses on predicting the final grades of Portuguese secondary school
students based on key social, demographic, and past school performance attributes. The datasets that we will use to train and test
our algorithm are the Student Performance Data Set from the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, both from
Portuguese public secondary schools, containing Math and Portuguese Language marks collected during the 2005-2006 school year.
The combined dataset contains 1044 observations and 33 attributes. (Note: There are 382 students present in both datasets,
Portuguese and Math grades, but we are stacking them instead of merging them in order to artificially increase our training data.)
